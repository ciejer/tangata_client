>“Hutia te rito o te harakeke  
Kei whea to kōmako e kō?  
Ki mai ki ahau  
He aha te mea nui o te Ao?  
Maku e kī atu,  
he tāngata, he tāngata, he tāngata..."

If the heart of the harakeke *(flax plant)* was removed,  
where would the bellbird sing?  
If I was asked what was the most important thing in the world  
I would be compelled to reply,  
it is people, it is people, it is people.  
*Ngaroto*

In te ao Māori (the Māori world view), Tāngata (*TAHNG-uh-tuh*) describes something much larger than an addressed group of people: it describes *whakapapa*, the surrounding network of ancestors and descendants we are connected to.  
With this work we intend to follow these principles to put our people first: not just the data & analytics engineers, but those around our workplaces that know the deep details of how our businesses actually run.  
These people are the lifeblood of what we do - and to keep moving forward, we need their context far more than ever.

## Repository Purpose
This codebase is the React front-end of https://github.com/ciejer/tangata_local, which includes a compiled version of this application - to run, follow the instructions there.

## To Build / Run
`npm run` compiles the app for testing, pointing at a server on localhost:80
`npm test` compiles the app to the /build folder, to be copied into a tāngata_local installation.

## I have an idea!

Please log all feedback in the GitHub Issues on https://github.com/ciejer/tangata_local, where it will be triaged across the projects - your feedback is crucial to make this a useful tool for the community.
